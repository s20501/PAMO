        Scrambled eggs\n
        Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.\n
    STEP 2\n
    Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Don’t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.\n
    STEP 3\n
    Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.\n
    STEP 4\n
    Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.\n
    STEP 5\n
    Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.\n
    STEP 6\n
    Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay."\n
